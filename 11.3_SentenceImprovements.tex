\section{Incorrect Answers}

On sentence improvements, the correct answer will be grammatically correct. Therefore, before
you see if an answer choice makes sense in the original sentence, determine if it is grammatically
correct. If not, then you can eliminate this right away.

\bigskip
\textit{Directions: Eliminate the answer choices that are grammatically incorrect for the following sentences. After you have elimintated an answer choice, write why it was incorrect on the line. The first one has been done for you.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Boston Common is \ul{ older than it but still just as well-maintained as Central Park}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]

\item older than it but still just as well-maintained as Central Park \textbf{ \ul{Eliminate because of ambiguous pronoun}}
