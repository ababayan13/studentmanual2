\section{SAT Worksheet: SAT Writing Multiple Choice Practice with Subject-Verb Agreement}

\textit{Directions: In the following sentences, box the subject and circle the verb that agrees with the subject.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{I never have\/has long fingernails because I bit them.}


\item{Finding happiness from multiple sources is\/are important.}


\item{The dolls in the storage closet sits\/sit on the shelf.}


\item{Plastic engineering, a booming field in many countries, have\/has many important applications.}


\item{Reading papers is\/are the best part of my day.}


\item{The trails, which I climb daily, widen\/widens towards the end.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Using the Correct Verb Tense}

Knowing when to use different verb tenses are important for SATs. Sometimes, you can look for
clues based on other part of the sentence. For example, Based on his previous experiences, Jared
decides/decided to pursue a career in education.

\bigskip
It can be difficult to determine if something should be simple present, past, or future versus present
perfect, past perfect, and future perfect. For example, when should you use \/waited versus \/had
waited"?

\begin{itemize}
\item{We use the simple tenses when there is one year or date. For example, World War II
began\/had begun in 1939.}
\item{We use past perfect when an action has started and it is interrupted by another action (past
tense). For example, World War II occurred\/had occurred for two years before the United
States entered it in 1941.}
\item{We use present perfect for an action that began in the past and continues to the present.
Explain the difference between the following sentences:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Scott had lived in New York for five years before he decided to move.}
\item{Scott has lived in New York for five years, although he is currently considering moving.}
\item{``The conditional (would) is used for hypothetical situations. The basic formula is \/If . . .were
. . .would." If I \textit{was\/were} to win the lottery, then I \textit{would} travel around the world.}
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
