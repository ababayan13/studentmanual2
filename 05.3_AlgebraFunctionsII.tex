\section{Quadratic Equations}

\bigskip
\textbf{General Equation:} If $f(x)$ is a quadratic functions with roots $r$ and $s$, then the coordinate of the vertex (maximum or minimum) is

\[\left(\frac{s-r}{2},\ f\left(\frac{s-r}{2}\right)\right)\]

\item Reese jumps, starting from the ground, and reaches a maximum height of 6 feet at 3 seconds. How long does the trip take from when she first jumped until she returned back to the ground?

\vfill\item A cannonball is fired from ground-level and hits the ground after $t$ seconds. If the maximum height is $h$ ft, write the coordinate that expresses the maximum of the cannonball's trajectory.

\vfill\item The sum of two integers $x$ and $y$ is $m$ and the product of the two integers is $n$. What is $n$ in terms of $x$?
