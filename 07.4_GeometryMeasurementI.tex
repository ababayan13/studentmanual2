\section[Special Triangles]{Pythagorean Theorem and Special Properties of Isosceles, Equilateral, and Right Triangles}

\textbf{General Equation:}

\begin{center}
The Pythagorean Theorem

$a^2+b^2=c^2$
\end{center}

\vfill\textbf{Example 1:} The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 16 cm. What is the triangle's area?

\vfill\textbf{Example 2:} Gretchen and Samuel leave school. Gretchen walks $45^\circ$ due south west and Samuel walks $45^\circ$ due south east. If they each live a quarter mile away from school, what is the distance between their houses?

\vfill\textbf{Example 3:} A 13 ft ladder is propped up against a wall. If the base of the ladder to the base of the wall is equidistant of the top of the ladder to the base of the wall, what is the difference between the length of the ladder and the base of the ladder to the base of the wall?
