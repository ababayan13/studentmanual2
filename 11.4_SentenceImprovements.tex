\section{Practice with SAT Sentence Errors and Improvements}

\subsection{SAT Warm Up Sheet}

\textit{Directions: Use the strategies that we have discussed to answer the following Sentence Improvement and Error SAT Questions.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dangling from the trees, \ul{we were frightened by the monkeys that tried to steal our sunglasses.}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item we were frightened by the monkeys that tried to steal our sunglasses.
\item we had been frightened by the monkeys that tried to steal our sunglasses.
\item the monkeys frightened us because they tried to steal our sunglasses.
\item we were frightened by the monkeys who had tried to steal our sunglasses.
\item the monkeys that tried to steal our sunglasses frightened us. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

In SAT sentence improvement problems, you should try to eliminate the 2-3 answer choices that are grammatically incorrect so that you are left with 2-3 other answer choices. The SAT sentence improvement section is looking for the ``best'' sentence, one that is concise and precise. In SAT world, this translates to the sentence that is not only grammatically correct AND concise. How does the SAT measure ``conciseness''? By length.

\bigskip
Therefore, the answer choice that you are looking for is grammatically correct and short without changing the meaning of the original sentence. The latter part means that it can not be so short that it is missing a key part of the original sentence,
but this is not usually an issue on sentence improvement problems.

\bigskip
\textit{Directions: Go back to the previous exercise and look at the answer choices that you haven't yet eliminated. Find the shortest answer. Then, check if it preserves the original meaning of the sentence by reading this answer choice in place of the underlined part of the original sentence. If so, this answer choice is the correct answer, so you should mark it. The first sentence is done as an example.}
