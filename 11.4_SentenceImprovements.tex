\textit{Directions: Go back to the previous exercise and look at the answer choices that you haven't yet eliminated. Find the shortest answer. Then, check if it preserves the original meaning of the sentence by reading this answer choice in place of the underlined part of the original sentence. If so, this answer choice is the correct answer, so you should mark it. The first sentence is done as an example.}
