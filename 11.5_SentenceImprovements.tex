\textit{Directions: The following sentences test correctness and effectiveness of expression. Part of each sentence or the entire sentence is underline; beneath each sentence are five ways of phrasing the underlined material. Choice A repeats the original phrasing; the other four choices are different. Select the choice that completes the sentence most effectively.}

\bigskip
\textit{In making your selection, follow the requirements of standard written English; that is, pay attention to grammar, choice of words, sentence construction, and punctuation. Your selection should result in the most effective sentence -- clear and precise, without awkwardness or ambiguity. \textbf{After you have selected the correct answer choice, you need to mark why the other four answer choices are incorrect, just like in strategies 1-3.}}
