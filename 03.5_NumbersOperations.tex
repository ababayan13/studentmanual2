\textbf{Example 1.} Liang is playing a game with a standard deck of cards. He wants the first card he picks up to be either a red card or a face card (Jack, Queen, or King). What is the probability he will choose either a red card or a face card?

\vfill
\textbf{Example 2.} In the set of integers from 1 to 100 (inclusively), how many numbers are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both?

\vfill
\textbf{Example 3.} Mr. Dropal has 16 students in his class. There are 10 male students. Half of all students are taking only Chinese and one-quarter are taking Chinese and French. If the class must take either French or Chinese, what proportion represents the maximum number of females taking only French?
