\section{About the SAT Writing Section}

Your score on the SAT writing section is dependent upon your performance in three sections, two multiple choice sections and one essay section. The essay section is the \hrulefill on the SATs and consists of \hrulefill essay assignment. You will have \hrulefill minutes to complete the essay. We will focus on the essay in a later chapter. 

In this section of the SAT manual, we will concentrate on the multiple choice sections. There are two multiple choice sections, one with \hrulefill questions to be completed in \hrulefill minutes and one with \hrulefill questions to be completed in \hrulefill minutes.
