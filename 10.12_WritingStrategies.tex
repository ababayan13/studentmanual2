\section{Practice SAT Writing Questions}

\bigskip
Directions: Read the question and circle the underlined portion that contains an error. If there's an error, identify the error (for example, a clause error) and then write a correction to the error in the space around the question. Note: On the real SATs, you will just need to circle the error rather than describing the error type and making a correction to the incorrect underlined portion.
