%Strategies for sentence error questions

%For the beginning:
\textit{For example, try the following sentence error and sentence improvement questions.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If Rob was wealthy, then he would be able to afford a luxurious car and a gigantic home. 
\item The young girls reported that they wanted to be cheerleader in high school. 
\item Holding a treat, the dog was persuaded to come back into the yard by the owner. 
\item Many people were protesting American involvement in South Asia in 1968, as they believed that the Vietnam War was unjust. 
\end{enumerate}

While this is not a grammar class, it is imperative that we learn the grammar concepts that are a) tested on the SATs and b) that students have trouble with on the SAT writing section. After discussing the grammar concepts, we will apply these strategies to SAT writing practice problems. 


Code continues from 10.11 Word Choice

These will use prepostitions such as in, on, by, upon, for, with, etc. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item advocate \longline
\item  agree \longline 
\item arrive \longline
\item comment \longline
\item demonstrated \longline
\item effects \longline
\item insist \longline
\item interested \longline
\item known \longline
\item look \longline
\item look favorably \longline
\item to plot \longline
\item preoccupied \longline
\item to provide \longline
\item regard \longline
\item suggested \longline 
\item to work \longline
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Other common errors:}
The following is a list of other common errors to discuss as a class. After each topic, correct the sentence:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Adverbs vs. Adjectives: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item She walked slow to class. 
\end{itemize}
\item Comparatives vs. Superlatives: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item When choosing between the red dress and the green dress, Laura thought that the red one was the prettiest. 
\item Of all the animals in the zoo, Madeline liked the zebra better. 
\end{itemize}
\item Sentence Fragments: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item While going hunting for a bear in the woods.
\end{itemize}
\item Redundancy: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to the pervasiveness of cell phones is the reason that many people do not buy separate digital cameras anymore.
\end{itemize}
\item Run-ons: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item Every day, the maid completes a list of chores written by the homeowner that are extremely tedious but she does not mind doing them because she is well compensated. 
\end{itemize}

\item Less versus Fewer: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item Adam has less friends than Andrew does. 
\item Adam has fewer money than Andrew does. 
\end{itemize}

\item Passive Voice: \hrulefill
\begin{itemize}
\item The large water coolers were filled up by the team manager. 
\item The bed was made by the soldier every morning. 
\item The large collection of stuffed animals were asked to be seen by the preschoolers. \\
\textit{The last sentence also contains another error. Find it and fix it!}
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

Hints for the SAT Writing Section
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Being}- The word ``being" is extremely informal. Therefore, on the sentence improvement questions, if some of the answer choices include the word ``being" and others do not, the correct answer will most often not contain the word ``being". 
\item \textbf{Formality of language}- Just because a sentence ``sounds right" doesn't mean that it is! The directions state that the errors in the SAT writing questions will be that of \textit{ standard written English.} Sometimes the way that we talk is not grammatically correct. Therefore, the SAT writers will often try to trick you into an answer you may have heard in English speech before, but it may be incorrect because it violates standard written English. This is why we started this chapter with proper grammar rules. 
\end{itemize}

\section[Sentence Error]{Strategy for Sentence Error Multiple Choice Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Know the directions. The directions for the sentence error questions are as follows:

\textit{The following sentences test your ability to recognize grammar and usage errors. Each sentence contains either a single error or no error at all. No sentence contains more than one error. The error, if there is one, is underlined and lettered. If the sentence contains an error, select the one underlined part that must be changed to make the sentence correct. If the sentence is correct, select choice E. In choosing answers, follow the requirements of standard written English.}

\vfill
\item Know which types of errors are frequently tested in sentence errors. This includes: Subject-verb agreement, Pronoun reference, Parallelism, Adverbs vs. Adjectives, Tenses, Singular-Plural Noun Inconsistency, Comparatives vs. Superlatives, Sentence Fragments, Shift in Point of View, You and Me Errors, Idioms, Redundancy, Word Choice, and Hypothetical Statements.
\vfill 
\item Your goal on the sentence errors is to determine whether or not there is an error in the sentence. If so, then you must mark the error. Read through the sentence. If you clearly hear an error, then mark it. On sentence errors, you are done.
\vfill
\item If you can't hear an error, check for the errors listed in this writing section. If you see one of those points that are incorrect, then mark it. 
\vfill
\item If you don't this that there is an error, mark answer choice ``E". Many students get nervous when they can't find an error because they are unsure of whether there is an error or if the entire sentence is correct. Remember, answer choice, “E”, no error, is the correct answer in approximately 20\% of the questions. To feel better about choosing “E”, we recommend going through each of the blanks and labeling the grammar point covered. For example, if the word “you” is underlined, then the grammar point tested is probably pronouns. Then, remind yourself of this grammar rule and ask yourself if it is properly executed. If so, then move on to the next one. If you finish answer choice “D” and there is still no errors, then “E” is most likely your answer choice.
\vfill
\item If you can't decide if there is an error or not, skip the question for now and come back to it after you have finished all the other questions in the section.

\section[Sentence Error]{Practice with Sentence Error Multiple Choice Questions}
\textit{Directions: The following sentences test your ability to recognize grammar and usage errors. Each sentence contains either a single error or no error at all. No sentence contains more than one error. The error, if there is one, is underlined and lettered. If the sentence contains an error, select the one underlined part that must be changed to make the sentence correct. If the sentence is correct, select choice E. In choosing answers, follow the requirements of standard written English. \textbf{If you selected answer choice A, B, C, or D, then after the question, write the type of error and also a correction to the error.} The first question has been done for you as an example.}
