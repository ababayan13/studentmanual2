\section{Use Formal Language and Proper Grammar}

Even though you only have 25 minutes to write the SAT essay, you should still do your best to
use formal language and proper grammar.

Informal words that should not be used on the SAT include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item thing
\item like
\item stuff
\item a lot
\item excessive cliches
\end{enumerate}

Grammar errors frequently seen on SAT essays include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item incorrect or inconsistent verb tense
\item using the pronoun "we" without defining the antecedent
\item using fragments instead of real sentences
\end{enumerate}
