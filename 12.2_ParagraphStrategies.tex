The SAT writing section always includes 6 questions dealing with paragraph improvement. Here's
the general strategy for approaching paragraph improvement questions:

\section{Skim the Passage}
The writing section is less about comprehension and more about grammar and sentence relation-
ships. With practice, it'll be easy to deduce a lot of answers without reading the full passage. In
fact, answering questions as you go along will often give you the enough context to answer other
ones.

Unlike the other parts of the writing section, these questions dont ascend in difficulty as you go.
Because some of the easier questions may be placed at the end, its important that you get to as
many questions as possible.
