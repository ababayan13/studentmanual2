\subsection{SAT Worksheet: Practice with 2-Blank Sentence Completion Questions}
 
\textbf{Strategy for 2-Blank Sentence Completions}
When you see a sentence completion question with two blank spaces, you will be asked to idenitify the combination of words in the answer choice that is appropriate for both blanks. While this usually looks more intimidating than the 1-blank questions, they are frequently easier than the 1-blank questions because incorrect answer choices are easier to eliminate.  


If you are looking through the answer choices but the other doesn't, then this is \textbf{not} the correct answer choice and you should \textbf{cross out the entire answer choice}. In this manner, you can often eliminate incorrect answer choices by eliminating the first word or the second word. If you don't know what the first word in the answer choice, see if the second word makes sense or vice versa. 

\bigskip
\textit{Directions: Complete the following example as a class. Cross out the answer choices in which one or both of the words do not make sense in the sentence.}

%Make some of the 1st anwer correct and some with the 2nd answer are incorrect.
Do not \underline{\hspace{2in}} the your meaning with a \underline{\hspace{2in}} of fancy words. Rather, speak clearly and simply. 

\begin{enumerate} [label=(\Alph*)]
\item intimidate \ldots debacle
\item synthesize \ldots colossus
\item temper \ldots harangue
\item obfuscate \ldots plethora
\item abrogate \ldots laceration
\end{enumerate}
