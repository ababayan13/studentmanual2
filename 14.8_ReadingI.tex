\section{Connotations}

Connotations, the emotion attached to a word, can also be helpful in figuring out what type of
word that you want to filll in the blank if you are having a hard time figuring out the definition
of the word. Words can have negative, positive, or neutral connotations. For example, the word
quack has a negative connotation, whereas the word doctor has a positive connotation.

But how can you use this on the SATs? If you know that the blank has a negative connotation, that means that you are looking for an
\underline{\hspace{2in}} answer choice with a connotation and can eliminate all of the words that have a \underline{\hspace{2in}} connotation.
