\item \textit{``Happiness can only exist in acceptance.'' -George Orwell}

\textbf{Assignment:} Is it better to accept and be happy with what you have, or to always seek greater sources of happiness?

\item \textit{``None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.'' -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe}

\textbf{Assignment:} In extolling the virtues of our freedom in schools, do we solidify freedom as a value to be protected, so do we teach children to be complacent about freedoms lost? Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.
