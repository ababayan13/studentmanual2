\section{Read the Lines Relevant to the Question}

Once you've determined the question type, you may need to read some lines in the passage for
context. The relevant lines will typically be either a sentence or two above or below the target
sentence. Sometimes, it will be necessary for you to read the entire paragraph.

For questions that ask about the whole passage (questions about the main idea, title, thesis, etc.), it is important to consider the entire passage. Many answer choices will only encompass information from one or two paragraphs rather than the passage as a whole.
