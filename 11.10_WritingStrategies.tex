\section{Faulty Comparisons}

Items being compared must have the same identity. For example, a dog can not be compared to
another dog's toys. While this might sound easy, it isn't always easy because our brain is used to
making the correct comparison even if it is written incorrectly on the page.


For example,

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Spot is better than Ziggy's toys.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{The sentence is trying to compare Spot and Ziggy or Spot's toys and Ziggy's toys.}
\item{The sentence is actually comparing Spot and Ziggy's toys.}
\item{This sentence can be corrected at least two different ways. Spot's toys are better
than Ziggy's toys. OR Spot's toys are better than Ziggy's.}
\end{itemize}

\item{Paul's pet rock is larger than Jim.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{What two things is the sentence trying to compare?} \hrulefill
\item{What two things is the sentence actually comparing?} \hrulefill
\item{Re-write the sentence so that it is grammatically correct (Note: there are at least two
ways to do this.):} \hrulefill
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
