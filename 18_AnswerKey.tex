\section{Chapter 10: Strategies for Sentence Improvements and Sentence Errors}

\subsection{SAT Worksheet: Warm-Up}

\textbf{Note: Answers ordering the difficulty of the question types will differ. Most students find improving paragraphs the most difficult}

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}

\item Answer: C But also advice of what and how to get to various destinations. Explanation: We must maintain parallel structure in the sentence. ``...not just (nouns) but also (we also want a noun here rather than the verb ``tells'').''

\item Answer: E No error

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{About the SAT Writing Section}

Fill in the following words (in bold) in the section. 

Your score on the SAT writing section is dependent upon your performance in three sections,
two multiple choice sections and one essay section. The essay section is the \textbf{first section} on
the SAT and consists of essay assignment. You will have \textbf{25} minutes
to complete the essay. We will focus on the essay in a later chapter.
In this section of the SAT manual, we will concentrate on the multiple choice sections.
There are two multiple choice sections, one with \textbf{35} questions to be completed in \textbf{25}
minutes and one with \textbf{14} questions to be completed in \textbf{10}
minutes.

\subsection{Types of Writing Multiple Choice Questions}

Fill in the following words (in bold) in the section.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first type of writing multiple choice questions is \textbf{sentence improvements}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this type of question, one part of a sentence will be underlined and you will be asked to pick the version of the underlined part of the sentence.
\item This type of question is found in both the 25-minute and the 10-minute multiple choice sections.
\end{itemize}

\item The second type of writing multiple choice questions is \textbf{sentence errors}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this type of question, you will be asked to identify whether or not there is an error in the sentence given, and if so, circle the location of the error. You will not be asked to correct the error on the SAT.
\item This type of question is found in the 25-minute multiple choice section only.
\end{itemize} 

\item The last type of writing multiple choice questions is \textbf{essay}

\begin{itemize}
\item Approximately half of the questions are sentence improvement and sentence revision.
\item The other questions are paragraph or essay structure and logic questions.
\item There are a total of 6 paragraph improvement questions on the SAT, all in the 25-minute section.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mastering Sentence Improvement and Sentence Error Question}

Review as a class.

\subsection{Verb Tense}

Verbs must agree with their subject in number. Many errors on the SAT writing section is related to subject-verb agreement and verb tense.

Subject-Verb Agreement

\begin{itemize}
\item This is manageable when sentences are straightforward.
\item For example, fill in the following blanks: He \textbf{is} smart. They \textbf{are} smart.
\item To make the questions more difficult, the SAT will separate the subject and the verb with prepositional phrases or descriptions with commas. An SAT question may also put the verb before the subject.
\item For example: Stephen for more than two weeks \textbf{is} happy because of his most recent grades. To solve
this type of question, identify the subject and cross out prepositional phrase. Then, identify the correct verb form.

\bigskip
Looking at it like this indicates that the subject is ``Stephen'' and so ``is'' is correct form of the verb.

\item{For example: The group, consisting of two adults and five children, \textbf{is} camping this weekend. To solve this type of question, identify the subject and cross out description (between the commas). Then, identify the correct verb form.}

\bigskip
The subject is ``the group'' and so ``is'' is correct form of the verb.

\item For example: Running \textbf{is} the girls' favorite sport. To solve this type of question, rearrange the sentence so that the subject comes before the verb. Then, identify the correct verb form.

\bigskip
The sentence is re-arranged as ``The girls' favorite sport \textbf{is} running.``Therefore, the correct verb form is ``is.''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SAT Worksheet: SAT Writing Multiple Choice Practice with Subject-Verb Agreement}

\begin{enumerate}
\item have
\item is
\item sit
\item has
\item is
\item widen
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
Using the Correct Verb Tense

\begin{itemize}
\item Note: The following refers to the sentences about Scott living in New York.

\item The first sentence \textbf{uses the past perfect. He lived in New York and then decided to move. It is implied that the decision to move also happened in the past rather than the present.} whereas the second \textbf{uses the present progressive tense. He is currently living in New York and is considering moving but hasn't done so yet.}

\item If I \textbf{were} to win the lottery, then I \textbf{would} travel around the world.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip Sample SAT Practice Questions

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item B requiring. Explanation: This is a violation of parallel structure and as a result verb tense. The correct answer should be ``required'' (participle) rather than requiring (progressive) because this is a daily condition rather than what is happening at this exact moment. 

\item C pledge to. Explanation: We need a verb tense that matches ``inspired''. Therefore, we should use ``have pledged to'' (the present perfect) rather than ``pledge'' (perfect tense). You may argue that there is not an error because you may hear the original phrasing spoken. This is an example of where spoken English is not always grammatically correct. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pronouns}

Agreement with the Antecedent

\begin{enumerate}
\item The noun that the pronoun replaces.
\item Kenna. Explanation: ``Her'' refers to ``Kenna the dog''.
\end{enumerate}

Unclear Pronouns

\begin{enumerate}
\item We are not sure who ``her'' refers to-- Emily or Kate.
\item Out of context, we are not sure who ``She'' or ``them'' is.
\item We are not sure if ``them'' refers to the rides or mice because both are plural nouns. If one was singular and the other was plural, the we would know the antecedent. 
\item The amusement park rides are full of mice, therefore we will avoid the rides by going to the movies instead. Here, we eliminate the pronoun ``them.''
\end{enumerate}

Consistent Point of View

\begin{itemize}
\item One. Explanation: later in the sentence, the pronoun ``one'' is also used and the pronouns must match. 
\end{itemize}

Sample SAT Practice Questions

\begin{enumerate}
\item No error. In this sentence, the pronouns clearly refer to the second grader. 

\item A were. From earlier, A note about SAT grammar: ``The conditional (would) is used for hypothetical situations. The basic formula is ``\textit{If \ldots were \ldots would''.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Misplaced Modifiers}

\bigskip SAT Worksheet: SAT Writing Multiple Choice Practice with Modifiers

\begin{enumerate}
\item Correct

\item Sarah thought that she would be able to move her car through the snow, which had come down lightly throughout the morning.

\item We were impressed with the holiday tree that was full of lights.
\end{enumerate}

Practice SAT Questions

\begin{enumerate}
\item E No error. 
\item E The monkeys, dangling from the trees, frightened us when they tried to steal our sunglasses. Explanation: B and E are grammatically correct, but E is closest to the original sentence and more concise.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Parallelism}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``going to parties'' is a clause rather than a noun. Correction: Emily likes soccer, hockey, and parties. 

\item all of the items in the list should be able to start with ``to go to'' and then a noun. Correction: When at college, Emily likes to go to soccer games, football games, and frisbee practice. 

\item The verb tense before ``but'' does not match the verb tense of the verb after ``but''.This is difficult to pick up on because we often hear the incorrect version in speech. Correction: Kelly likes going to the mall, but riding on the mall's elevators scares her.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
Practice SAT Questions

\begin{enumerate}
\item C The boy spoke French, Spanish, and Russian fluently. Explanation: A and C are grammatically correct but C is more concise. 

\item C decides. Explanation: This is a parallel structure error because of incorrect verb tense. The past is used in the rest of the sentence, so the present tense verb ``decides'' is incorrect. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Faulty Comparisons}

\bigskip
2. Paul's pet rock is larger than Jim.

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item Paul's pet rock and Jim's pet rock
\item Paul's pet rock and Jim (the person)
\item Paul's pet rock is larger than Jim's. OR Paul's pet rock is larger than Jim's pet rock.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
SAT Practice Questions

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item D author. Explanation: The sentence as written is comparing J.K. Rowling's books and the new author. 

\item B he. Explanation: Because the cameraman is talking to the celebrity, we can infer that the pronoun ``he'' refers to the celebrity. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Word Choice}

\begin{itemize}
\item idioms. \textbf{The SATs describes idioms as phrases (usually prepositional) that go together.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item to
\item with
\item to
\item to
\item for or to
\item against
\item upon
\item with
\item to
\end{enumerate}

\item commonly confused works. \textbf{Effect is the noun form and affect is the verb form. Watch out for easily confused words, like allusion and illusion or averse and adverse.  Allusion and illusion are called homophones, or words that sound the same but have different spellings and meanings.}

\item incorrect word choice

\bigskip 
\textit{Note that parallel structure is particularly important in these situations!}

\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{ and. She was deciding between going to the movies and going to the mall.}

\item \textbf{or. She could either go to the movies or go to the mall.}

\item \textbf{nor. Since her car ran out of gas, she could neither go to the movies nor go to the mall.}

\item \textbf{but also. Since she had the entire weekend free, she could not only go to the movies but also to the mall.}

\item \textbf{rather than. She went to the movies rather than the mall.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Practice SAT Questions
\begin{enumerate}
\item C or. Explanation: The phrase should read both to \ldots and.

\item A effected by. Explanation: The word in the blank is a verb, so it should be ``affected by.''
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other Common Errors}

\begin{itemize} 

\item Adjectives describe nouns. Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.  Adverbs often end in –ly. \textbf{Replace diligent with diligently because diligently describes a verb, worked.}

\item Comparatives, like better, worse, faster, smaller, compare two things or people.Superlatives, like best, worst, fastest, and smallest, describe one thing as the best of many or compare three or more things or people.\textbf{Replace more with most because it is assumed that there are more than 2 suits in the entire store.}

\item Fragments may contain a noun and a verb but they do not contain one or more independent clauses. Fragments must be corrected to form complete sentences. 

\bigskip
For example, a fragment may not be a sentence because\ldots

\begin{enumerate}
\item It describes something, but there is no subject-verb relationship
\item It may have most of the makings of a sentence but still be missing an important part of a verb string.
\item It may locate something in time and place with a prepositional phrase or a series of such phrases, but it's still lacking a proper subject-verb relationship within an independent clause.
\item It may even have a subject-verb relationship, but it has been subordinated to another idea by a dependent word and so cannot stand by itself.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{This phrase given is not a sentence. There must be an independent clause added to the phrase or the phrase could be re-worded to make a sentence. For example, ``When Sam was headed to the store, his mother asked him to return home.'' OR Sam was headed to the store.''}

\item Watch out for wordiness and unnecessary repetition. \textbf{Delete the phrase ``rather than happiness'' because the sentence already states that the goal is to be happy.}

\item Try to break up long, wordy sentences that contain lots of clauses with a period or semi-colon. \textbf{After Luke wrote a list of all of the chores that he wanted to accomplish for the week, he set out to complete each one with a renewed sense of purpose and pride. He did not let himself get distracted by the fact that many of his friends thought that he could not accomplish everything he had written in such a short amount of time.}

\item The SAT want you to use active rather than passive voice. (Subject-verb-object rather than object-verb-subject) \textbf{The  author turned in the newspaper article an hour after the deadline.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practice SAT Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A quickly. Explanation: This is an adjective versus adverb error. ``Quick'' describes a verb (walk), so it should be in its adverb form, quickly. 

\item B me. Explanation: This is a pronoun error. The proper phrasing is between you and me. 

\item A as. Explanation: This is a word choice error. The correct phrasing is ``as \ldots adjective \ldots as'' so the word should be ``as'' instead of ``although''. 

\item A demonstrated. Explanation: This is a subject-verb agreement error and a verb tense error. The verb demonstrate must agree with its subject, each, in number. Also, the action took place in the past (``last year''), so the correct verb should be demonstrated. 

\item D a superhero. Explanation: This is a subject-verb agreement error. The object, superhero, must agree with its subject, five students, in number. Five students can not become one superhero, so instead the phrase should read ``become superheroes. 

\item C you.  Explanation: This is a pronoun consistency error. Earlier in the sentence, the pronoun ``one'' is used, so ``you'' should be replaced by ``one''. 

\item D was funny. Explanation: This is a parallel structure error. Previous items in the list, humor and acuity are nouns so the phrase ``was funny'' should be replaced with the noun ``the ability to be funny.'' One may argue that humor and the ability to be funny are the same, so the latter could be deleted. Fortunately, sentence error questions only ask you about the error, not how to fix it. 

\item C was. Explanation: This is a subject-verb agreement issue. The subject, Ray Charles, is singular, so the verb, were, must also be singular. Were is plural and should be replaced with the word ``was''. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SAT Worksheet 1C: Warm-up}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{B}. Explanation:  This sentence can be improved by changing the gerund `'reporting'' to its noun form, `'the report.''
\item \textbf{C}. Explanation:  Wordiness.  Improve this sentence by simplifying `'for it will encourage'' to simply ``to encourage.''
\item \textbf{B}. Explanation:  Shift in point of view.  The subject needs to stay the same in both clauses.  It is incorrect to switch from second person ``you'' to first person plural ``our.''  Changing ``you'' to ``we'' in the first clause fixes this problem.
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%% Chapter 11 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Strategy for Paragraph improvements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quickly read over the paragraphs and take note of the \textbf{main idea of the essay}. \textbf{Mark} any grammatical errors that you see right away because there will probably be a question about that.
\item Then look at the \textbf{first question}.  
\item Reread the sentence in context. Read the sentence \textbf{before} and the sentence \textbf{after} the line in the question. 

If it is a sentence improvement question, look for the ``alerts" and other errors in the Writing Multiple Choice Part I and Part II. 

If it is a sentence addition or move question, ask yourself, ``does it fit where it is, or would it be better somewhere else?" Remember: The sentences need to be coherent. Frequently, the SAT tests this by making the first part of the sentence similar to the last part of the previous sentence (that is, discussing the same topic as the second half of the previous sentence). 

If it doesn't discuss the topic(s) presented in the sentences around it or otherwise seems random, it may need to be removed completely. 

If you think that it should stay where it is, you can re-visit the option of fixing it.  If it's a run-on, try shortening it or splitting it into two sentences.  This tests the same skills as Sentence Improvement questions.  Before you “improve” the sentence though, make sure it belongs where it is!  Always consider sentences in context.

\item Think of \textbf{your own answer choice}.
\item Look at the answer choices.  \textbf{Select} the one that comes closest to your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SAT Worksheet 2C: Exercises for Improving Paragraphs}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Exercise 1: Fragments}

Is there Life on Mars?

The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if a story of life began on Mars at all. \textbf{Sample correction: Hence, if a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of life on the earth.} We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look for highly intelligent beings on Mars.

But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who made a lifelong study of Mars, there are hundreds of straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or pipes by means of which the ``Martians'' draw water from their polar ocean. \textbf{Sample correction: The late Professor Percival Lowell, who made a lifelong study of Mars, said that there are hundreds of straight lines drawn across the surface of the planes \ldots} Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles. There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.

Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapor in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. And they point out that, as the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the sun is so great. \textbf{Sample correction: And they point out that, as the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the sun is so great, there probably isn't water} If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points, one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees. \textbf{Sample correction: Combine the previous two sentences.}

In August, 1924, the planet again be well placed for observation, and we may learn more about it. \textbf{Sample correction: In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation, and we may learn more about it.} Already a few of the much-disputed lines, which people wrongly call ``canals,'' have been traced on photographs. Astronomers who are skeptical about life on Mars are often not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our ``elder brothers'' may yet flash across space the solution of many of our problems.

\item \textbf{Exercise 2: Transitions and Conjunctions}

The following are sample answers. Answers may vary.

As a recently permitted driver, I have become familiar with some of the laws that the Massachusetts State Legislature has enacted in an attempt to curb the number of accidents involving teen drivers. These admirable bills have saved the lives of the state's children and made the roads safer for all drivers and passengers, not to mention pedestrians. \textbf{However}, it is of grave concern that there is currently very little regulation of the age group with the second highest number of motor vehicle crashes, the elderly (age sixty-five and older). The passage of proposed Bill 1914 will mandate that ``the registrar shall require that all persons aged 85 or older who are seeking to renew their operator's licenses take a vision and road test before being reissued such license''. \textbf{As a result}, I am writing to urge your support for this precedent-setting bill.  

Those unfit to operate a vehicle are literally ``accidents waiting to happen'', jeopardizing their own lives and endangering public safety when they operate an automobile. According to the Governor's Highway Safety Bureau, older drivers were involved in 18,743 crashes in Massachusetts in 2002 \textbf{and} this age group was responsible for over 12\% of all motor vehicle fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that these statistics continue to rise steadily \textbf{as} the number of traffic-related deaths in the general population decline.  
	
Opponents of this bill may argue that since few elderly people are licensed to drive, they do not pose a serious threat on the road. This is an oversimplification \textbf{because} the number of seniors driving in Massachusetts totaled more than 858,000 in 2000. The aging of the Baby Boom generation \textbf{and} medical advancements have contributed to an increase in elderly drivers. \textbf{Consequently} these problems can only escalate, as the National Institute on Aging predicts that in 30 years, the number of drivers over the age of eighty-five will be five times greater than today. Using this conservative estimate of the number of drivers and current accident rates, it is forecasted that this increase in population will result in the tripling of traffic fatalities caused by this age group. \textbf{Moreover} legislation passed now will lower preventable deaths and will also have widespread implications for the future. 
 
Currently, the only people that are required to have their vision checked are first time license applicants and those persons renewing their licenses at a Registry branch. People of any age who renew their license online are exempt from this personal screening. This is relevant information \textbf{because} researchers at the University of Alabama concurred with a 1995 Johns Hopkins University study which found that state-mandated vision tests of elderly drivers are successful in lowering their accident rate.

\textbf{Therefore}, Bill 1914 does not seek to deprive elders of their independence by mandating that senior citizens forfeit their license at a certain age; \textbf{instead}, the bill assures that those who choose to drive are able to safely do so.   

\item \textbf{Exercise 3: Sentence Order in a Paragraph Directions:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 4
\item 2
\item 5
\item 1
\item 3
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The whole paragraph reads as follows:}

Images of 1920s America is one of endless parties, bootlegging, and flappers doing the Charleston all night long. Throughout the novel, The Great Gatsby, the character of Mr. Gatsby is at the center of this stereotype. Coming from humble, mid-western roots and arriving at his current living situation, complete with domestic servants and a forty-acre mansion, his story seems to be the epitome of the American dream. He learns, however, that he can not use his power to buy the sole object of his affection, Daisy Buchannan. Although money correlates to economic power in 1920's American society and allows some leverage in other arenas, the powerful Mr. Gatsby is ultimately rejected by Daisy due to socio-economic class divisions.

\item \textbf{Exercise 4: Making an essay clearer and more concise}

\textbf{The following boldface sentences or phrases can be deleted or moved:}

\textbf{College in the United States is extremely expensive.} With tuition costing as much as \$60,000 per year, many parents and students are worried about paying for college. There are many opportunities for students to get money for school from outside organizations, government agencies, and the particular university that they hope to attend. Students can get grants or scholarships that do not have to be paid back in addition to loans, which students begin to pay back after graduation. \textbf{For example, a student named Ben Kaplan was so worried about paying for Harvard that he wrote scholarship essays that earned him over \$90,000 for college. Would be better later in the essay.}

Students don't have to be the valedictorian or a star quarterback, in fact, lots of qualities, interests, and affiliations will make students eligible. \textbf{Lots of different students can get money for college!} Many organizations, including companies, non-profits, and unique heritage groups, award scholarships--there are scholarships for almost everything. Parents and students should start searching early in the college process and \textbf{not wait until the last minute. There are also national contests for high school writers, historians, and scientists, such as the Ayn Rand Essay Contests, National History Day Contest, and Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. The previous sentence would be better if it was moved to the last sentence of the paragraph.} There are many online resources such as finaid.org and fastweb.com to help students find scholarships. Students can search for books about obtaining money for college, such as How to Go to College Almost for Free, at local libraries, bookstores, and high school guidance departments.  Students can also call local businesses and associations and ask if they have any scholarships or contests with prize money. Some national groups have awards as well. 

In order to get federally backed loans from their university, students need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) online.\textbf{ Each college also gives out a certain number of merit-based scholarships to attract students to their schools. This sentence is better moved later in the paragraph to the part about merit-based scholarships.} After filling out the FASFA, students are sent the Student Aid Report (SAR).  Colleges use the SAT to determine student's financial aid package, that is to say colleges use this to estimate how much money a student's family can contribute to tuition and how much money a student is able to borrow. \textbf{The best way to get this type of scholarship is to have a high GPA and SAT score relative to the current freshman class. This sentence is better moved later in the paragraph after the introduction of merit-based scholarships} Strong students are awarded merit-based scholarships. Students can also ask about the number and amount of merit-based scholarships that by calling the school or asking an admissions officer during their college visit.  These sentences are better moved later in the paragraph to the part about merit-based scholarships. With scholarships and financial aid, it 'pays' to plan!

\item \textbf{Exercise 5: Dividing an essay into different paragraphs}

\textbf{Note that the bolded sentences are where a new paragraph begins. You may want to provide the hint to students that there are 4 paragraphs.}

\textbf{The poetry of Robert Frost and Thylias Moss were influenced by different events, which attributed to the contrasting attitudes toward similar subjects in their poetry.}  Frost, living in New England, was influenced by serenity and breathtaking scenes of nature. His poem, “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening” epitomizes this, as the Speaker desperately desires to watch the woods fill up with snow, but regretfully acknowledges that he must continue on his journey before he can rest. With thoughts of the beauty of his home, Frost's mood is joyous. Not all poets, however, are as agreeable as he. When writing “Interpretation of A Poem By Frost”, Thylias Moss describes the filling up of woods with snow through the bleak perspective of a young African American girl. In both poems, diction and imagery work collaboratively to establish the two dissimilar tones of the authors. While Frost's attitude towards the metaphorical woods is cheery and appreciative, Moss's seems to be angry and frustrated. 

\textbf{In creating the different tones of voice, Frost and Moss utilize contrasting choices of words.} Frost utilizes passive diction, “easy wind and downy flake”, as well as end rhymes to create a pleasant atmosphere. The rhymes make the poem flow smoothly and the words sound gentle, pleasing to the ear. These combine to produce a lighter mood than in the poem by Moss. The latter author employs words such as “inter”, “emptiness”, “polarity”, “edge” (synonymous for sharp), and “defiance”. The use of these harsh words verifies her feelings toward the subject as angry. The most apparent difference in diction, however, are the words chosen to describe the animal. Frost playfully calls the creature a “little horse” who shakes his harness bells when the Speaker stops to look at the woods. Moss refers to it as a “limited audience”, and believes the girl's efforts of defiance to be wasted on something so unworthy as a horse. Frost's lively description of the horse and entire scene contrasts Moss's degrading and cruel one, representative of Frosts relaxed tones and the overwhelming frustration felt by Moss. 

\textbf{Both authors employ imagery and the connotations of words to establish the different emotions.} Frost describes the environment: woods lovely, dark, and deep, and the frozen lake. In the background, the snow falls down softly, and the only noises are peaceful, that of a light wind and downy flake, and horse bells jingling merrily. After reading this, many imagine a peaceful scene, one which could easily be set during winter holidays (which also conjure feelings of great pleasure). On the other hand, Moss paints an entirely different picture of the landscape. In her poem, the girl is surrounded by an aura of emptiness- not welcome and serene like the former poem- but eerie and frightening. She views as the snow “inters the grass”, which for the readers results in many visualizing violent images of the snow relentlessly beating on the frail grass. Moss uses these morose images to establish her attitude towards the poem, while Frost's jovial illustrations reflect his serene attitude. 

\textbf{The Speakers of both poems experience different metaphorical journeys, and the tones of the authors on current issues in the poems significantly affect their views of the future.} The work “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening" ends with the lines, ``I have miles to go before I sleep, I have miles to go before I sleep”. This suggests the Speaker still has things to accomplish in his life; yet, impacted by Frost's appreciative and joyous temperament, he believes the rest of the journey- the future- will also be something to be enjoyed, as beautiful as the woods described in the beginning of the piece. While Frost's feelings of the present-day imply the future will be pleasurable, Moss's frustration continues. Moss reflects on society, believing there are, ``miles to go, more than the distance from Africa to Andover, more than the distance from black to white before she sleeps with Jim". Moss's anger stemming from prejudice influences her to predict a bleak future; she believes that racism will still be a problem, as she has observed that diverse peoples seem unwilling to cooperate and tolerate each other. The overall meaning of ``Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening", authored by an optimistic Robert Frost, is one should appreciate life- now and in the future; however, Thylias Moss's contrasting tone of anger and frustration expresses the challenges of a young African American, and implies unless drastic social measures are taken, intolerance will only continue.

\item The beginning clause is passive.
\item The gerund in the beginning makes it seem like we're all currently``thinking''
\item Corrects the point of view error by maintaining ``we'' as the subject
\item Point of view error - unnecessarily shifts between ``you'' and ``we''
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Answer (C)}

These are all transition words. Sentences 2 and 3 point out quite a few things that come up when privacy is thought about. Sentence 4 implies that although a lot of things related to privacy do come up, there are still more things that we cannot imagine. The keyword there is ``still,'' which is the transition word that should be used.

\item \textbf{Answer (B)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item The problem here is pronoun reference. The word ``this'' does not refer to anything within the sentence.
\item Correctly indicates what ``this'' should refer to and transitions smoothly from the previous sentence.
\item Too abrupt and too simplistic a statement to really relate back to the previous sentence. The reader is left asking, ``so what?''
\item Does not correct the pronoun reference error mentioned in (A).
\item Too wordy and the phrase ``as an example'' is disconnected - as an example of what?
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Answer (A)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Correct. Best expresses the cause and effect relationship between the two sentences.
\item Run-on. ``Therefore'' is not a conjunction.
\item Starting the sentence with ``with'' is awkward and does not establish the desired cause and effect relationship clearly.
\item The cause and effect relationship is not made clear. Protecting patient information and facing liability are presented as almost two separate things.
\item Misuse of the word ``liable.''
\end{enumerate}


\item \textbf{Answer (B)}

The second paragraph deals with hospitals and how they deal with privacy issues. The paragraph is NOT about lawyers.

\item \textbf{Answer (E)}

Sentence 11 talks about possible consequences and sentence 12 expands upon what those consequences might be. Those consequences for violating patient privacy are the ``hypothetical result'' that sentence 12 elaborates on.

\textbf{Passage 2 (about Korean food)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Answer (C)}

Although other answer choices are grammatically correct, C is the most concise of these answer choices.  

\item \textbf{Answer (C)}

This sentence should go in between when ingredients were scare (and therefore, according to the sentence, they had to cook imitations) and when they were more readily available. This is sentence 4. 

\item \textbf{Answer (D)}

The original sentence contains a modifier error. Only answer choices B, C, and fix this. B contains an unclear pronoun, ``it''. C is incorrect because the clause at the beginning of the sentence does not make sense. 

\item \textbf{Answer (B)}

The original sentence contains a modifier error. Only answer choices B and C fix this. B is both grammatically correct and more concise than C. 

\item \textbf{Answer (D)}

``According to the past'' is implied, given the tense of the word ``signified''. 

\item \textbf{Answer (B)}

Correct use of connectors. ``and'' is not the most logical connector between the two clauses. 
\end{enumerate}
