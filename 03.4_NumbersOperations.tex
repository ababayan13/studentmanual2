\item Gumdrops come in bags of 60. Mr. Lee wants to buy enough bags so that he has a perfect square number. What is the least number of bags Mr. Lee will need to buy?

\vfill\item The sum of the angles of a regular polygon is given by the equation $S(n)=180(n-2)$ where $n$ is the number of sides. How many sides does the smallest regular polygon have if is the smallest regular polygon possible such that each individual angle is over $120^\circ$?

\vfill\item A group of $n$ students participate in a math competition. The students are required to shake hands with all other participates in the competition. If each handshake between two people is counted only once, how many distinct handshakes are there overall?
