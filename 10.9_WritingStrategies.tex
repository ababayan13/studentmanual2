\section{Parallelism}

Clauses within a sentence must have the same phrasing (parts of speech or verb tenses). This
frequently happens to items in a list. Parallelism can also apply to the paragraph improvement
section where consecutive sentences have similar structure.

\bigskip
For example,
\begin{enumerate}

\item{Emily likes soccer, hockey, and going to parties. What is wrong with this sentence?} \hrulefill
Write a correct version of the sentence: \hrulefill
\item{When at college, Emily likes to go to soccer games, football games, and play frisbee.} What
is wrong with this sentence? \hrulefill
Write a correct version of the sentence: \hrulefill
\item{Kelly likes to go to the mall, but riding on the mall's elevators scares her. What is incorrect
about this sentence?} \hrulefill
Write a correct version of the sentence: \hrulefill

\end{enumerate}
