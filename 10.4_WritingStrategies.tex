\section{Mastering Sentence Improvement and Sentence Error Questions}

The SAT Writing multiple choice section may seem intimidating at rst, as there is a lot of reading (particularly for the sentence improvement and paragraph improvement questions) as well as many questions to answer in each section. However, the SAT tests standard English grammar, which means that if students learn a handful of grammar rules--particularly the ones featured in this
section--then they will be able to complete many questions in the SAT writing section carefully.

\bigskip
Remember, the SATs tests \textbf{proper grammar} as well \textbf{conciseness}. How we talk is not always
grammatically correct, and therefore not the correct answer on the SATs. Be cautious of this,
particularly on the later (more difficult) questions. We will address the issue of conciseness in the
next chapter, but usually if you have narrowed a question down to two or three answer choices
that are each grammatically correct, the correct answer is the shortest answer choice.

\bigskip
Verb tense, pronouns, misplaced modiers, parallelism, faulty conjunctions, and idioms are the six
most commonly missed errors on the SAT Writing multiplce choice section. By reviewing these
grammar concepts as well as completing the practice problems, you should be able to answer SAT
Writing multiple choice questions more accurately.
